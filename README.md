# How to download the free version of Typora

Good afternoon. I really like one small program for composing texts in md format. While it was in beta, it was free to use. And in principle, this version has enough functionality for me. After the release of the main version, it became paid. It costs $14, but I donâ€™t want to buy it: firstly, there are other free analogues, and secondly, if you can use the legally free version, why not.

There is a very interesting resource that will help us in this matter. As we know, the Internet remembers everything, or almost everything. So let's take advantage of what the Internet has preserved for us.

And we will use the resource of https://archive.org

Go to this site and search for the site you are looking for, namely https://typora.io

In the story that appeared, we can see when this resource was created and how it developed

Snapshots of the site are not taken every day. But you can see from the size of the circles that there were several pictures on a given day. For 2023, we won't find what we're looking for. To do this, let's move on to 2022, then to 2021 and to the desired 2020. We need the latest snapshot date in 2020. It was then that it was still possible to download the beta version of the program. We'll see

Save, install and use. After installation, we can see the version

If you are not embarrassed by this method, use it. Good luck to everyone!
